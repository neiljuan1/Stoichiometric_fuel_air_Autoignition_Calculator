# Autoignition Calculator for Stoichiometric n-octane/air mixture

## Objectives
The autoignition process involves a feedback loop where:
<ul>
  <li> Chemical reactions produces radicals and heat
  <li> As tempearture rises, the chemical reaction rate increases
  <li> chain branching occurs, producing more radicals
</ul?

The ignition delay is the time it takes for the buildup of heat and radicals until explosive effects occur. The Autoignition calculator calculates the time taken until ignition occurs. In this main example, the autoignition time is obtained for n-octane with air in stoichiometric conditions.

## Assumptions
<ul>
  <li> Constant pressure
  <li> Stoichiometric conditions
  <li> Adiabatic conditions with no dissociation
  <li> Constant specific heat, obtained at the initial temperature
  <li> Fuels are gaseous and buring in air
</ul>
